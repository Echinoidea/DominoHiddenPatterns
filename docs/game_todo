Raylib for game

Rules based AI. How do I make an AI that actually plays well?
Block dominoes:
1 - place doubles
2 - place high pip count tiles
3 - place tiles with multiple of same suit in hand if possible
4 - remember which tiles opponent draws on and play tiles with that suit
5 - deck contains 8 tiles which contain at least one of each value, 
    count the number of tiles on board and in hand with one of each value to 
    predict how many of each value is in opponents hand or boneyard.
    Count the number of each value tile in your hand + the number of that value tile
    on the board. Place the value tile from your hand that has the highest occurences in hand and board.
